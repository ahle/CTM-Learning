# CTM-Learning - Part I

In this section, we implement CTM learning for the collaborative editing systems. 
We have world assumption as following:

*Human agent*

An editor, a system designer or any kind of users of editing systems who interact with the editing sytems for correcting the documents

*Assistance agent*

An intelligence agent observes the user interaction and helps the users. 

*Environment*

TConnect Editor v0, the enviroment types is defined: 

* Fully observable (vs. partially observable)
* Deterministic (vs. stochastic)
* Episodic (vs. sequential)
* Static (vs. dynamic)
* Discrete (vs. continuous)
* Single agent (vs. multiagent)

Our environment of course is semi-dynamic because the world state could change while the user correct the documents.
